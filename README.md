# YodaSpeechConverter
A simple android app which converts our normal speech to Yodish(Yoda's speech)

I implemented the use of volley library 
Used YodaSpeech API from - Rich (https://github.com/richchurcher/yoda-api)
i learnt how to copy text to your clipboard in android.
Overall it was really fun to design the UI and make it look attractive.
